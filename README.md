# Wayfarer Project

## Description

Wayfarer is a world city review app that allows users to see information of various cities and post reviews/comments about the city.

## Technologies used
* Angular
* node.js
* Typescript

## Planning

Once our team based the design and functionality of the app on wireframe and user stories provided by the client.

### User Stories

A user should be able to:

1. View the "San Francisco" page (at "/cities/1") including:
* The site-wide header.
* The name of the city.
* An iconic photo of the city.
2. View a list of posts on the San Francisco page:
* Sorted by newest first.
* With the post titles linked to the individual post "show" pages.
3. Use the search bar to search through the posts' title and/or content.
4. Click on the title of one of their posts and be redirected to a "show" page for that post.
5. View post "show" pages with title, author, and content.
